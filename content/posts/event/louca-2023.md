LOUCA 2023 was an absolute blast, and from the moment I stepped through the Welcome Gate, I knew it was going to be an extraordinary experience. The event organizers went all out in creating a magnificent entrance that set the tone for the entire affair. The sheer excitement was palpable, and I couldn't wait to dive into the event.

My talk, centered around the innovative topic of Kolla OpenStack on ARM Ubuntu (aarch64), was met with an incredible reception. The audience turnout was exceptional, and seeing so many eager faces in the crowd added an electric energy to my presentation. Their enthusiasm mirrored my own passion for the subject, creating a vibrant exchange of ideas and insights.

I want to extend a massive shoutout to the organizers who worked tirelessly to make this event unforgettable. The venue was not just good; it was fantastic, providing the perfect backdrop for knowledge sharing and networking. They even offer a delicious lunch for all attendees of the event!

But the greatness didn't stop there. The event organizers thoughtfully curated a city tour of Surakarta that left everyone in awe. Exploring the local culture and soaking in the vibrant atmosphere added an extra layer of enjoyment to an already incredible event.

In short, LOUCA 2023 was a holistic experience that ticked all the boxes. The Welcome Gate set the stage, my presentation was met with enthusiasm, and the overall event â€“ from venue to food to city tour â€“ was nothing short of spectacular. Kudos to the organizers for creating an environment where knowledge thrived, connections were made, and memories were forged. Can't wait for the next one! ðŸš€âœ¨
